# Python Sorting and Searching Algorithms
This is a repo containing contain some searching and sorting algorithms. This ReadMe provides a short description of each algorithm

For each sorting algorithm the user will be asked to enter a length of an array and the values in that array. For searching algorithms the user will be asked for the same inputs but also a target value to search for.

## Searching Algorithms

### Linear Search

Linear Search is probably the most basic searching algorithm. It sequentially checks each element in a list until it finds an element that matches. If the algorithm reaches the end of the list, the search ends without any success.
